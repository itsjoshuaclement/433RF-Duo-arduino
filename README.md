# 433RF-Duo-arduino
Code for a 433MHz RF Wireless Transmitter and Receiver module.
I had a lot of issues trying to find help when I was first learning about these devices. 
This code specifically controls the position of a partial rotational servo by measuring 
the value outputted by a potentiometer.

Here are the RF units I used:
